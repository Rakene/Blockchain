# Blockchain Project

## Introduction
This project is adapted from a class project from Blockchain Algorithms and Systems taught by Professor Hank Korth at Lehigh University. It is a proof of concept of generic blockchain using proof of work.  There is also simple smart contract written in solidity that represents an insurance policy for farmers against inadequate rainfall.

## Code Base
bash recompile.sh
- This command recompiles all the code.

bash run.sh
- This command runs the code.  It asks for paths to input files and creates .out files.

bash test.sh
- This command runs tests on the code. It asks for a path and creates a Test.txt there.
- The Test.txt contains the results of the tests.

code/java
- This directory contains all the different files that are compiled to make our project work.

code/solidity
- This is a smart contract written in solidity that is an insurance policy for farmers against inadequate rainfall.
